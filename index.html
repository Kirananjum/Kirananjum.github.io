<h2>Here's a bit about me:</h2>
<p>A native New Yorker! Trust me, this city has its ups and downs but at least they're cute restaurants and rooftops everywhere! I'm definitely all about the brunch life, so not basic right?</p>

<p>I'm turning 21 this month and I have to say I'm kinda freaked out, the adult life is scary. I'm currently a student at The New School and the big dream is to make it in the fashion industry. Yes, I've watched The Devil Wear's Prada a million times already.</p>

<p>It's definitely intimidating. I mean as a South Asian, you would assume I was on the path to becoming a doctor or a lawyer but you know you have to study what you love.</p>

<p>I went to an all girls school for about 7 years and wore uniform my whole life, not having to pick an outfit each made life a billion times easier!</p>

<p>If there's anywhere I could be right now, it would be Paris or anywhere in Europe. I think everyone has come to a conclusion that I need to move to there already. <img src=https://www.instagram.com/p/BJTAnxWAGoG/?taken-by=kiranxanjum" Alt= Summer in Paris">
